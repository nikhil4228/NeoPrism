            <h3>Application Packaging and Virtualization</h3>
            <p>Using windows installer service as a packaging and deployment mechanism can help lower the costs associated with application deployment and maintenance. Application packaging involves preparation of standard, structured software installations targeted for automated deployment using different deployment tools like Microsoft SCCM, Novell Zenworks and Altiris. With latest developments in Virtualization technologies like Microsoft App-V, VMware Thinapp and Citrix profiling the cost of application packaging and time has been reduced drastically.

By streamlining software configuration and deployment, application packaging can help reduce application management costs.</p>
